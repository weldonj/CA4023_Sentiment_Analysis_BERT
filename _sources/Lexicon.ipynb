    "# Lexicon Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "For this approach I abandoned the previous work and structural setup. I used the sentiment lexicon by Minqing Hu and Bing Liu - Mining and Summarizing Customer Reviews. ACM SIGKDD-2004, found at http://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/opinion-lexicon-English.rar\n",
    "\n",
    "This contains two .txt files, one with 2006 \"Positive\" words and one with 4683 \"Negative\" words. \n",
    "\n",
    "My plan was to store all of the positive words in a list, and all of the negative words in another list. I then take each of the txt files from our dataset and count how many positive words show up in it, and how many negative words show up in it. If there are more positive words than negative words I classified this document as positive and if the opposite were true I classified it as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the negation handling method that we saw earlier to preprocess our data set as I feel it should help when comparing the documents to the sentiment lexicon."
